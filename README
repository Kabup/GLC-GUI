          GLC-GUI
 A gui for glc-capture,
     from nullkey

Using the pulseaudio version 0.5.8-git-
from Sebastian Wick <wick.sebastian@gmail.com>

Notes:
glc-capture is a excellent tool, to
record video from your games, is fast
and reliable, and the pulseaudio version
fixed the issue with audio recording.

What was missing, in my opinion, was a
gui program, a interface to deal with
the options in the command line. I did
expend a lot of time testing and checking
several configurations, until I found the
best one, in my case.

A graphical interface can help to set
things faster, so I build one. Is not
complete, but it works. It still in
phase alpha, so let me know for bugs
and/or issues, and I'll try to fix them.
