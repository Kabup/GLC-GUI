For a quick install, just follow these steps:

tar -xzvf glc-gui.version.bz
cd glc-gui
make
make install

note: glc-gui is a interface only, the
real job is done by glc-capture, you
can get it from nullkey, here's the
repository:
 https://github.com/nullkey/glc/wiki

I'm using a changed version, to work
with pulseaudio, from swick:
 https://github.com/swick/glc
