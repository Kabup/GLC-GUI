---------------------------------

GLC-GUI was build using GTK and Glade.
You need to install glc from nullkey, or
the modified version from swick if you are
using pulseaudio. The repositories are below.
Also, install aoss (sudo apt-get install alsa-aoss)
to prevent errors when running glc-play (also, if you
are using pulseaudio).

For a quick install, just follow these steps:

open a terminal, and cd to the dir where you download
the files.
tar -xzvf glc-gui.version.bz
cd glc-gui
make
then, just execute glc-gui from the terminal.
(you can clean up the directory by typing:
rm *.o *.c *.h README CHANGELOG INSTALL
and move all the directory
to another place, if you want).

PS: glc-gui is a interface only, the
real job is done by glc-capture, you
can get it from nullkey, here's the
repository:
 https://github.com/nullkey/glc/wiki

I'm using a modified version, to work
with pulseaudio, from swick:
